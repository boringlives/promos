There are three different choreographers that are known for being the innovators of lyrical dance: Jimmy Peters, Cheyla Clawson, and Phyllis Balanga-Demoret. Much like ballet, lyrical is a gentle style of dance that incorporates elements of grace and fluidity in movement and technique. Unlike ballet, lyrical is a style that was popular on competitive dance stages, making it attractive to many career-oriented dancers.

Lyrical used to incorporate an emphasis on emotion and lyrics, but now the emotional aspect of lyrical is performed in a more abstract manner.
