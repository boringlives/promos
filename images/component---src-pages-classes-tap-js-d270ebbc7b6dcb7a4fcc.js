Our instructors provide students with various musical props to help the dancer not only connect the rhythm to their feet but make the connection in their minds as well.

As the style of dance which is the most percussive, tap dancers learn how to be the music and how to identify and apply a variety of time signatures, comparable to music theory. Gaining this skill will benefit them in every other style of dance that they pursue, opening the doors to an all-encompassing experience using mind, body, and ears! Counting music is essential to all dance forms– encourage your child to start early! With strong foundations in musicality and logical awareness, tap dance can be a complex style but keeps the mind engaged and thinking. Tap dancers develop their focus skills during every class, as they learn new patterns/combinations and build on to previous ones. Creating rhythms takes more than just a simple stroke of the ground– it requires the ability to count music while undergoing physical activity, simultaneously. In turn, tap dancers have strong coordination skills and are able to think in unconventional and creative ways, as they identify and dance to different layers in any piece of music. Also, being exposed to a tap class not only helps dancers develop long-lasting friendships, it presents them with unique challenges that they perhaps would not experience in a different activity.
