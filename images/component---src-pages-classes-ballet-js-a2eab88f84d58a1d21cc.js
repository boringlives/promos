At Ascendance, we recognize that ballet is the foundation of all dance language. Based on stylized music and a classic foundation, we strongly emphasize the importance of ballet technique in our classes. Usually performed to instrumental music, students are guided through the basics of ballet from positions, barre work, and exercises across the floor, to other floor work and combinations building strength and technique. Since ballet is at the core of all dance styles, it is integral in our curriculum. Ballet is precise, highly formalized, and disciplined. It will strengthen dancers beyond their own expectations and allow them to develop proper and fundamental dance technique. Dancers will become physically stronger, develop their core muscles, lengthen their muscles, and challenge their minds. They will improve their posture, balance, musicality, grace, and flexibility.

We divide our ballet classes by age groups in the following manner: ages 3 to 4, ages 5 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 to 12 years old, and teens. Our age groups are broken down this way so that each class is at a manageable size, where every child receives individualized attention from their instructor. It also helps students to build relationships with other students in their similar age group, which often times leads to friendships that last a lifetime.

Ballet engages the entire body from head to toe, requiring focus and discipline.

Ballet can benefit the stiffer dancer in that it promotes grace and fluid movement. On the other end of the spectrum, dancers with lack of body control would benefit from a ballet class so that they can translate their movement into purposeful and technical execution. Ballet also has the advantage of encouraging proper posture, can be low impact, and is a healthy activity that those who partake in can enjoy for the rest of their lives. This is true both inside and outside of the classroom. Moreover, it is an effective medium for your child to gain self-confidence, develop social skills, and explore a new activity!
